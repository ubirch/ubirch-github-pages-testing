## Components
The ubirch library consists of three parts which can be used individually:

**[API](@ref ubirch.ubirch_api.API)** - `ubirch.ubirch_api.API` 

- A python layer covering the ubirch backend REST API

**[Protocol](@ref ubirch.ubirch_protocol.Protocol)** - `ubirch.ubirch_protocol.Protocol`

- The protocol compiler which packages messages and handles signing and verification

**[KeyStore](@ref ubirch.ubirch_ks.KeyStore)** - `ubirch.ubirch_ks.KeyStore`

- A simple key store based on [pyjks](https://pypi.org/project/pyjks/) to store keys and certificates
