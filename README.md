# Testing functionalities of GH Pages

To be able to use Github Pages this repo has to be public.

Here is tested what can be found later in the [function documentation](https://developer.ubirch.com/function_documentation/ubirch-protocol-python/) pages 
or [documentation sites](https://developer.ubirch.com/ubirch-protocol-python/)
like the one from [ubirch-protocol-python](https://github.com/ubirch/ubirch-protocol-python).
